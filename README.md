# Php-Practices 

This repository contains the practices completed during Level One of the Learn Laravel Path from Laracasts. In this level, the basics of Laravel were covered, including routing, controllers, and views using Blade templating. It also included building simple applications and working with databases using Laravel's Eloquent ORM. Key concepts such as form validation, user authentication, and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern were introduced to provide a solid foundation in Laravel development.
